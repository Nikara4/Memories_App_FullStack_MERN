# Memories Application - Full Stack MERN Project

A Full Stack MERN application coded using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB alongside the tutorial: [Full Stack MERN Project ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QREj8te1P7VSwhrMf3D3Xt4V6_SRkhu) by JavaScript Mastery.

### Status of application

Right now I am in the middle of the course and the application needs a fix. The 500 internal server error pops up while trying to post data to the server.

The styling will be altered by me to suit my needs and to practice styling with JS and Material UI.
