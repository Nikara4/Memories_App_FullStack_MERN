# Memories Application - Full Stack MERN Project

A Full Stack MERN application coded using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB alongside the tutorial: [Full Stack MERN Project ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QREj8te1P7VSwhrMf3D3Xt4V6_SRkhu) by JavaScript Mastery.

You can access the GitHub source code here: [project_mern_memories](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_mern_memories)

### Status of application

The application has been succesfully deployed and is available for access: [MERN App Memories](https://mern-prj-memories.netlify.app/)

Right now I am working on implementing the functionalities from the rest of the videos (authentication, search, comments).

The styling will be altered by me to suit my needs and to practice styling with JS and Material UI.
